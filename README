== Milton

Milton is an extensible attachment handling plugin that makes few assumptions
but provides a lot of power.

== Dependencies

* Rails (for now?)
* A filesystem (more storage solutions coming soon...)

=== For Image manipulation (not required!)
* ImageMagick (more processors coming soon)

== Installation and Setup

Read the INSTALL file for more information.

== Testing

To add the Milton specs to your rails application:

 1. Copy the attachment_pow/ folder in the spec/ directory to the spec/
  directory in your rails application. Make sure you remember to move the
  folder and not just the files.
 
 2. More more ore...
